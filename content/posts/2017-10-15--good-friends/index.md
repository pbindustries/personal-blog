Hi I am Philip Bankier

I'm a lover of hardware/software and economics with dreams of createing a startup in which i utilize all 3 of these passions.

When im not geeking out over a new API or watching economics lectures i spend my time with my family and my friends. 
I love yoga, martial arts and basically anything outside.

Check out my project page for a list of current projects, any help is greatly appreciated!
