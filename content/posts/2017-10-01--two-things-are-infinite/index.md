After a lot of work and way too many refactors, i am almost ready to deploy a new website. It will display drone data that has been analyzed and visualized with the Elastic Stack.

### Why is this needed?

Since the introduction of military UAV, or drones, the US has used them for good and bad. 
The purpose of this project is raise awareness of exactly how and where our government is utilizing Drones.
