- Elastic Stack based Application Stack log analytics and security	
  - Aggregated logs from Nginx, AWS Cloudwatch/EC2/S3, MongoDB,Elasticsearch and the interaction speed and frequency between these services.
  
  - Created different dashboards that allow other developers to easily recognize the cause of bottlenecks, increased bandwidth and many other potential anomalies.
  
  - Main dashboard allows the user to view a variety of real time visualizations. These include an interactive world map of website requests, graphs displaying errors from across our application stack, and many more.
  
  - This project is proprietary but i offer an open source starter implementation  on my GitHub.

- Data analytics and visualization app for manager	
  - While working for Miso3 i built a proprietary app that allows managers to monitor there client/vendor/service/etc data in real time. 
  
  - The frontend was built with Angular 5/NgRx and the backend was Mongo/Mongoose/Node.Js, with Elasticsearch/Kibana/Elastic Beats for Data aggregation, analytics and visualizations.
  
  - This project is avaialble to Miso3 employees and is deployed with continuous integration. 
  
  - Working on improving time-series analytics.

- Financial Planning Web/Mobile Application - 5-person project - JavaScript/CSS/HTML/Python	
  - Built a web and mobile application that helps millennials develop financial literacy while also including useful tools to plan and maintain financial information.

  Trie-based Autocorrection Program - 1-person project - Java	
  - Built a trie data structure using a given set of "valid words."
  
  - Program traverses the given input, comparing each word to the Trie of already accepted words.
  
  - Outputs the correct part of the input and the closest "valid words," as well as a TRUE if the  given input is valid.

- Kruskal's Algorithm on an Undirected Weighted Graph - 1-person project - Java	
  - Implemented a Disjoint Set data structure with recursive path compression.
  
  - Applied Kruskal's Algorithm to calculate the minimum spanning tree of an undirected weighted graph (utilized the DisjointSet class).
